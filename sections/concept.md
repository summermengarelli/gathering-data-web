# What are APIs and how are they useful?

An **API**, or Application Programming Interface, is a behind-the-scenes connection between computer systems that can be used to serve up information for many purposes. For example, a sporting news company might use an API to fetch statistics from a football game, organize information on the points scored each quarter, then output that information in a visually pleasing way on their website for users to peruse. This can save the company time in the long run because they no longer need to ask someone to create a new score summary webpage for each game. They can simply point the API to a different game in their database and retrieve the same points-per-quarter information for output on the webpage.

Scholars can take advantage of the same technology for research if a website either allows access to everyone via a "public API," or provides an option for individuals to request a private **API key**, which acts similar to a private password.

For example, suppose you are studying paintings from the 19th century. You know an art museum holds a wonderful collection and grants users permission to download the images. The process takes forever, however, as you need 100 paintings. Moreover, it is difficult to connect up the images themselves with information about the images, such as artist, date, and genre. You must save each image, copy and paste each piece of information into a spreadsheet, then add the filename of the image to the spreadsheet. 

With an API, you could simply construct an **API request** that says, in essence, "Please give me the artist name, date of creation, genre, filename, and download link for all paintings made in France between 1860 and 1890." All the information would come back in a systematic way, and you would be only one step away from downloading the images themselves. Better still: if you later changed the criteria -- all Belgium paintings between 1870 and 1900, for example -- you would only need to make a small change to your API request and be on your way.

Let's start by looking at how API requests can be in your browser, using a resource called the Star Wars API.
